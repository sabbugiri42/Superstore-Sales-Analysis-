# Superstore-Sales-Analysis
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Superstore sales dataset to uncover key business trends. The analysis focuses on sales performance over time, identifies top-selling products, and visualizes regional sales data.

**Overall Growth:** The analysis shows a consistent increase in sales year-over-year.

**Top-Performing Categories:** The 'Technology' and 'Furniture' categories are the primary drivers of revenue.

**Regional Trends:** The West and East regions have the highest sales, while the Central and South regions are potential growth areas.

**Seasonal Patterns:** Sales peak during the end-of-year holiday months, indicating a clear seasonal trend.

This project was completed using the following tools:

**Python:** The core programming language for the analysis.

**Pandas:** Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Employed for creating data visualizations.

Before the analysis, the raw data was cleaned by:

  - Removing 11 rows with missing 'Postal Code' values.

  - Converting the 'Order Date' and 'Ship Date' columns to the correct datetime format for time-series analysis.

  - Creating new 'Order Year' and 'Order Month' columns to help analyze sales trends over time.

The analysis of sales data by year and month reveals a clear growth trajectory.

  - A bar chart shows that total sales increased steadily from 2014 to 2017.

  - A line plot demonstrates a strong seasonal pattern, with sales consistently peaking in November and December.

This section identifies the key drivers of the company's revenue.

 - A bar chart highlights 'Technology' and 'Furniture' as the highest-grossing categories.

 - A detailed bar chart of sub-categories shows that 'Phones,' 'Chairs,' and 'Storage' are the top performers.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the Superstore's sales performance. The key takeaways are the consistent growth, the dominance of technology and furniture products, and the predictable seasonal peaks. These findings can inform business decisions related to inventory management, marketing strategies, and regional focus.

To run this project, you will need a Python environment with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn installed. You can run the .ipynbfile in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab after uploading thetrain.csv file.
